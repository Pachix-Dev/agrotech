However, in order to maintain our competitiveness and become a global leader in this industry, it will be necessary to drive agricultural transformation.<br /><br />Mexico's great biodiversity is one of the main reasons for the high productivity of this sector, since approximately 13% of the national territory is used for crop production, which allows us to harvest close to 200 products in different seasons and seasons of the year. We are the 11th largest food producer in the world and the 7th largest exporter, as well as the 3rd largest food industry in the Americas. Our agri-food products, including avocados, tomatoes, blackberries, green chiles, raspberries, lemons and beef, are consumed in 164 countries with a potential market of 1,353 million people.<br /><br />In addition, our network of 12 trade agreements with preferential access to 52 countries means that our agri-food exports are increasing year after year. During the first half of 2023, in our country, exports in this sector amounted to 31,487 million dollars, while the export of agro-industrial products exceeded 17 billion dollars, 6.74% higher than the same period in 2022.<br /><br />Mexico is today a leading player in this industry, so AgroTech Mexico is designed to bring the revolution to the field by adopting the latest trends in Machinery and Equipment, Agrotechnology, Agricultural Inputs, Greenhouses and Water Management, allowing accelerating the construction of a more competitive, efficient, sustainable future, providing innovative solutions for the optimization of production processes throughout the industry, facilitating integration into global supply chains and promoting sustainable food production.<br /><br /><p class='text-center font-bold'>We look forward to seeing you at AgroTech Mexico 2024.</p>",
